                What is Retina Service?
            </h3>
            <p>
            Retina services within our center are aimed to be comprehensive both in terms of diagnosis and management. With the use of the latest diagnostic modalities such as Optical Coherence Tomography (using infrared light to view the structures of the back of the eyeball), fundus photography and Optical Coherence Tomography coupled with Angiography we are confident in our services. Our retina clinicians have obtained fellowship training from top-notch ophthalmology hospitals overseas (Germany, Japan, and New Zealand).
