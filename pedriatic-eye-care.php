                What is Pedriatic Eye Care ?
            </h3>
            <p>
            The pediatric clinic at our center involves expert clinicians to assess, diagnose and treat all kinds of childhood eye and vision problems such as amblyopia (lazy eye), refractive errors (need for eyeglasses), squint (deviated eyes) and congenital ocular anomalies. Our clinicians are up-to-date with the latest developments in treating childhood vision problems and adhere to the evidence-based practice guidelines. Our pediatric clinic is child-friendly with toys and colorful cartoon paintings so that children won’t get bored while waiting for ocular evaluation. Our clinicians can detect ocular and vision problems in children as young as newborns. Child visual system is vulnerable to maldevelopment due to poor and uncoordinated use. In if not diagnosed and treated at the appropriate time, treatment becomes difficult at a later stage. Hence with the moto that no one child goes needlessly blind, we have come up with a slogan ‘Aankha Jachau, school Jau’. Under this program, we aim that children gets their first eye and vision exam at a hospital before entering the school.
