               What is Contact Lens Fitting ?
            </h3>
            <p>
            The contact lens clinic is a specialized clinic that provides all varieties of the contact lens to the patients. Our optometrists conduct a thorough assessment of your eyes and determine your eligibility to wear contact lenses. Various types and designs of contact lenses ranging from soft lenses to cosmetic colored lenses are available from our clinic. We also specialize in fitting contact lenses in irregular corneas such as keratoconus (conical protrusion of cornea) and post PK (eye condition after corneal transplant surgery).
